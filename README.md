Your go-to website for making random choices easy and fun! Whether you're deciding between lunch options, picking a movie to watch, or selecting who's up next for a game, qpick.app simplifies the decision-making process.

## How to Use qpick.app

### Making a Random Choice

1. **Gather Your Options**: Start by deciding on the items among which you want to make a random choice. These can be anything: names, places, activities, etc.

2. **Format Your URL**: Enter your options into the Pick1.me URL by appending them to the site's base URL in a comma-separated list. For example: https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger

3. **Get Your Random Pick**: Hit enter or navigate to the formatted URL in your web browser. Pick1.me will automatically select one of the options at random and display it on the screen.

### Fixing the Result with a Seed Value

1. **Choose a Seed**: Your seed can be any string, like a date (`2024-01-01`) or a word (`WhatDoWeHaveForDinner`). The same seed will always produce the same result from the same list of options.

2. **Format Your URL with a Seed**: Append the seed value to the end of the URL after a slash (/). For example: https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger/2024-01-01 https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger/WhatDoWeHaveForDinner

3. **Get Your Fixed Result**: Navigate to the URL with your seed value included. The website will display the choice determined by the seed value, providing a consistent result for the same input and seed.

### Tips for Using qpick.app

- Double-Check Your List: Ensure there are no unintentional spaces after commas in your list, as this might affect the random selection or seed result.

- Creative Seeding: Use memorable dates or words for seeds when you need consistent results across different sessions or for sharing with others.

- Share Your Picks: Easily share your choices with friends or colleagues by sending them the URL. They'll get the same random (or fixed) result as you did.
