  </p>

  <h2>How to Use QPick.app</h2>

  <h3>Making a Random Choice</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Gather Your Options:</strong> Start by deciding on the items among
      which you want to make a random choice. These can be anything: names,
      places, activities, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Format Your URL:</strong> Enter your options into the QPick.app
      URL by appending them to the site's base URL in a comma-separated list.
      For example:
      <a href="https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger"
        >https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get Your Random Pick:</strong> Hit enter or navigate to the
      formatted URL in your web browser. QPick.app will automatically select one
      of the options at random and display it on the screen.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Fixing the Result with a Seed Value</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose a Seed:</strong> Your seed can be any string, like a date
      (2024-01-01) or a word (the_food_for_party). The same seed will always
      produce the same result from the same list of options.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Format Your URL with a Seed:</strong> Append the seed value to the
      end of the URL after a slash (/). For example:
      <a href="https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger/2024-01-01"
        >https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger/2024-01-01</a
      >
      or
      <a href="https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger/the_food_for_party"
        >https://qpick.app/pizza,sushi,burger/the_food_for_party</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get Your Fixed Result:</strong> Navigate to the URL with your seed
      value included. The website will display the choice determined by the seed
      value, providing a consistent result for the same input and seed.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips for Using QPick.app</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Double-Check Your List:</strong> Ensure there are no unintentional
      spaces after commas in your list, as this might affect the random
      selection or seed result.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Creative Seeding:</strong> Use memorable dates or words for seeds
      when you need consistent results across different sessions or for sharing
      with others.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Share Your Picks:</strong> Easily share your choices with friends
      or colleagues by sending them the URL. They'll get the same random (or
      fixed) result as you did.
    </li>
  </ul>
