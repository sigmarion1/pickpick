  <h1>Welcome to Pick1.me</h1>
  <p>
    Your go-to website for making random choices easy and fun! Whether you're
    deciding between lunch options, picking a movie to watch, or selecting who's
    up next for a game, Pick1.me simplifies the decision-making process.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use Pick1.me</h2>
  <h3>Making a Random Choice</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Gather Your Options:</strong> Start by deciding on the items among
      which you want to make a random choice. These can be anything: names,
      places, activities, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Format Your URL:</strong> Enter your options into the Pick1.me URL
      by appending them to the site's base URL in a comma-separated list. For
      example:
      <a href="https://pick1.me/pizza,sushi,burger"
        >https://pick1.me/pizza,sushi,burger</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get Your Random Pick:</strong> Hit enter or navigate to the
      formatted URL in your web browser. Pick1.me will automatically select one
      of the options at random and display it on the screen.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Fixing the Result with a Seed Value</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Choose a Seed:</strong> Your seed can be any string, like a date
      (<code>2024-01-01</code>) or a word (<code>the_food_for_party</code>). The
      same seed will always produce the same result from the same list of
      options.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Format Your URL with a Seed:</strong> Append the seed value to the
      end of the URL after a slash (<code>/</code>). For example:
      <a href="https://pick1.me/pizza,sushi,burger/2024-01-01"
        >https://pick1.me/pizza,sushi,burger/2024-01-01</a
      >
      <a href="https://pick1.me/pizza,sushi,burger/the_food_for_party"
        >https://pick1.me/pizza,sushi,burger/the_food_for_party</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Get Your Fixed Result:</strong> Navigate to the URL with your seed
      value included. The website will display the choice determined by the seed
      value, providing a consistent result for the same input and seed.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips for Using Pick1.me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Double-Check Your List: Ensure there are no unintentional spaces after
      commas in your list, as this might affect the random selection or seed
      result.
    </li>
    <li>
      Creative Seeding: Use memorable dates or words for seeds when you need
      consistent results across different sessions or for sharing with others.
    </li>
    <li>
      Share Your Picks: Easily share your choices with friends or colleagues by
      sending them the URL. They'll get the same random (or fixed) result as you
      did.
    </li>
  </ul>

    At Pick1.me, we value your privacy. The service is designed to be
    straightforward and does not require personal information or registration.
    Your choices and seed values are processed on the fly, and no data is stored
    after your session ends.
